Heat Templates for OSH-Infra K8s deployment
===========================================

These templates build out a OSH-Infra k8s deployment. They are intended for
development use above a single node OSH developer deployment, to provide a
basic multinode env.

Instructions
------------

Once OSH has been deployed from the development deployment scripts, run the
scripts in the scripts directory in order.

Once complete, a simple five node k8s cluster will have been created, and
the master versions of OSH and OSH-Infra checked out under `/opt`.

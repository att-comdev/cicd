      "message": "Diff for this file looks perplexed so let me summarize:\n1. Added runGit internal function - to run git with configured credentials for repository\n2. Added cloneRepository function - aio function to clone any git/gerrit/codecloud/etc repo\n3. Added cloneUpstream/cloneDownstream functions for cloning code from upstream/downstream gerrit with convenience\n4. Older clone functions that used git plugin (clone with 2 and 3 parameters, _cloneWithCreds with 5 parameters, _clone with 4 parameters) are now refactored to use \u0027cloneRepository\u0027 instead, other old clone functions remain unchanged for now (to make sure we break as little as possible with this PS)\n5. All old clone functions are marked as deprecated and moved into special region in the end of the file to encourage developers to use newer cloneRepository/Upstream/Downstream instead.",

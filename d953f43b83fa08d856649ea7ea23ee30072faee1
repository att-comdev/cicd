      "message": "Because this command just create init repo without source code itself. The source code will be taken from this repo (from $PROJECT_REPO) in loci repo during execution of scripts/clone_project.sh (this script is a part of https://github.com/openstack/loci/blob/master/scripts/install.sh#L68)\n\nIn our job we do not have the point where we can modify the source code. It is only in loci logic. We have to patch loci code itself.",
